# Classroom Client
**Classroom Client** is my implementation of the Google Classroom for the Android platform.<br>  
This app is a client of the Google Classroom API and makes syncing CourseWorks for offline usage effortless for Classroom Students.

# Building
To build the app you need to configure a Google API Console project as stated here [Get Started Integrating Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating)<br>  
You can then Proceed to add the Classroom API to your project in the [developer console](https://www.console.developers.google.com/).<br>  
**Note:** The authorization flow used [here](https://developers.google.com/classroom/quickstart/java) doesn't work in an Android environment
