          <h1 style="text-align:center">Google Classroom Client</h1>

    <p><b>Classroom</b> is a minimal software targeted towards Students of various levels in order to access course material and announcements by Course Administrators on-the-go.<br>
        All limitations of this app is beyond the developer of the software and it has developed to make the most of the Classroom API.<br>
        The app was primarily created due to the poor state of the Google Classroom Android Application available on the Google Play Store.<br>
    <b>This Application requires the Updated version of the Google Play Services.<br>Download it before filling a bug report</b>
        <p style="text-align:center">Why choose <b>this</b> Classroom client?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Makes Course announcements by Administrators available offline in a nice user-interface</li>
        <li>Notifications for CourseWorks *</li>
        <li>Availability of Google Classroom Web UI mode to cater for the limitations of the Application *</li>
    </ul>
