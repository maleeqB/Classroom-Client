   <h5><a name="about">About App</a></h5>
   <p>This is a minimal implement of Google Classroom, the main
       idea behind this is to make Classroom Announcement available to Students
       when Offline.
       <br>Since the idea for the is Clear enough therefore there's no Support for Course Administrators
       <br>Certain features such as Creating Announcement in Classrooms have been disabled
   </p>
   <h5><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h5>
   <p>Even though the main purpose of the App is to sync Course state for Classroom students, 
       Users should be aware of the following liumitations:<br>
       <ul>
           <li>Comments on Announcement ain't available</li>
           <li>Only Course Administrators can View all Students in a given Classroom</li>
           <li>CourseWorks can't be submitted directly from the App</li>
       </ul>
       <br><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">Any other feature apart from these was only as a result of mere design Choice</span>
   </p>
   <h5><a name="drive_permission">Google Drive Document Requesting Permission</a></h5>
   When the Google Drive Account chooser dialog appears, open Attachments only with E-mail accounts 
   used for the given Classroom class.
   <br>In case you ain't signed into the  device with the Google Account used for the Classroom Course, consider signing into Google Drive with the Account.
   </p>
   <h5><a name="moving_to_top">App moving to top when loading Announcement</a></h5>
   <p>
       Once again this is only a mere design choice. The App automatically attempt to sync updates, and when updates are available it moves to the top and updates the Content of the Current View.
   </p>
    <h5><a name="sign_out_revoke_access">Sign Out or Revoke Access</a></h5>
        Consider signing out of the app only for simple cases such as switching between Google Accounts.
        <br>Revoking <b>Classroom Client</b> access disconnects this Application with your Google Account, Signing back into the app would require you to grant the Scopes required by the App again.
    </p>
   <h5><a name="ads">Ads</a></h5>
   <p>
       This is a <b>free</b> software. <b>free</b> here translates to both <b>Freedom</b> and <b>Price</b>, you probably downloaded both the Sources and binary output from the Github page.
       <br>Ads or any other addition content of such in the App is placed by devs with the Development machine.
   </p>
   <h5><a name="development">Developing the App</a></h5>
   <p>
       Developing the app should be straightforward, the source code was annotated as much as I could. I would be willing to post development tutorial on https://maleeqB.github.io, if you interested in building the app and feel stucked, send me a mail at malikbello084@gmail.com with the tag <b>Classroom Client</b>
